Python code for reading voting results to determine county participation and candidate

### Challenge

## Outcomes Based on Goals

* For play campaigns less than $5000 there is a strong likelihood of receiving the minimum funding (~75%).

Limitations
* This analysis excludes the 19 currently running (Live) campaigns though it's doubtful that including that data would skew the results that dramatically. They are roughly split into two ranges 1) less than $10k and 2) greater than $10k. As current, less than 10% of the smaller group has received minimum funding and 25% of the larger ground has received minimum funding. 

## Outcomes based on Launch Date
* As it stands, it looks like the time to launch is May and June as there is a big jump between April to May. While success drops in the two months that follow, June and July are still higher than any other month. 

Limitations
* This chart is not broken out by year. One hypothesis that could be tested is "Did Kickstarter as a company start mid-year so we may not have a full 'fiscal year' to compare to." While not broken out in the chart, the underlying data appears to confirm this as June 2014 is when data collection begins and runs through February 2017. As a result, its reasonable to expect March and April to flatten out the dip shown in those months. 

## Additional considerations:
* What may be interesting to view is a comparision (and possible correlation) between the percent of goal raised and the duration of the campaign. I expect this would be a scatter-plot to determine if any particular grouping emerges.
